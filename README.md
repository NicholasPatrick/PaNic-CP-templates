# PaNic-CP-templates

These are my (Nicholas Patrick, Pa.Nic on codeforces) competitive programming templates. Feel free to use any of these templates for any purpose. I do not provide any guarantee for the correctness of any of these codes. They're simply here to:
1. Proof that I didn't copy code from someone else if they happen to be using code I gave prior to some contest.
2. Show others my coding style, implementation style, and possibly have others suggest improvements for both the algorithms I use and the coding or implementation style.
3. Make my otherwise local templates accessible in the unlikely case that I'm competing in a different computer and am allowed to access the Internet.
4. Share my templates.

As of now, I find `disjoint_sparse.cpp` to be the only code you can comfortably use without worrying too much.
